title: "About This Website"
---

This is my first personal website which I am using to showcase my programming skills.  I have a couple more planned to host other content.  I will put links up in due course.

My name is Johnny Lau and I live in Edinburgh.  I am a CFA charterholder getting stuck into the data analysis world.

I come from a family of restauranteurs but much prefer being 'this side of the table'.
