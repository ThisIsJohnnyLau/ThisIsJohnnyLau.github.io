title: "A bit about me"
---

My name is Johnny Lau and I live in Edinburgh.  I have a passion for financial markets and am extremely delighted to discover the ever evolving world of data analysis.
  
As I have a background in science and engineering, R speaks to me loudest (due to its statistics heritage) so I am keen to connect with Python enthusiasts so that we might exchange 'best ideas' and learn from each other.  
  
I come from a family of restauranteurs but really quite like 'this side of the table'.  Much love in the world of F&B.
