**Bio:**

I am Jonathan Lau; a CFAÂ® charterholder looking to combine investment experience with freshly honed data analysis skills. Studying the intensive computer programming course at CodeClan allowed me to expand my investor toolkit, enhance my data-led communication skills and develop new ways of working; including adapting to lockdown. As a proud member of the Scottish Tech Army, I am currently contributing my skills to a COVID-19 data visualisation project for Scotland.
