Here you will find data analysis and programming related content, which I will continue to add to.  This is my first personal website - so please be kind (once I've gotten around to coding a feedback section(!))
  
  
I am relative newcomer but I have been absolutely bowled over by the culture of collaboration, knowledge-sharing and generosity that I have discovered in the global data analysis community.  I hope to embody that as I continue on my coding and data analysis journey.  
  
Shout out to my data analysis instructors at [Code Clan](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-analysis/) - **Stephanie Boyle**, **Del Middlemiss**, **Aileen McDonald** and **Mhairi McNeill**.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again, but you lot are incredible ambassadors for the data analysis community!  I'm so glad to have had you to guide my first steps.
