My name is Johnny Lau and I live in Edinburgh.  I have a passion for financial markets and a keen interest in the ever expanding world of data analysis.
  
With a background in science and engineering, R speaks to me loudest (due to its statistics heritage) so I am keen to connect with Python enthusiasts so that we might exchange 'best ideas' and (hopefully) learn from one another.  
  
I come from a family of restauranteurs but really quite like 'this side of the table'.  Much love to Edinburgh's food and drink scene!
